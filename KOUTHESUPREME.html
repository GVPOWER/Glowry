CHAPTER - 1
Who Owns Power? - The Introduction

No matter what is decided, when it is decided, But by whom it is decided has the most power. For anything we want to accomplish in our life, we rely on someone or something we trust the most. It may decide our prosperous life or our dreadful death, it is in our decision of us, to choose the right path, the path in which we are strong and more capable compared to the unwanted distractions that happened in our life. But what if, there was only one path and one ultimate goal which everyone had in common? Which everyone is aspiring to achieve it?
Are you ready to attain the Supreme power of life?

“The one who will attain the supreme power will experience everything that they had wanted in their dreams. But the end will always be the same for everyone!”

CHAPTER - 3
The Kano Legends - Magical History of Kano

Kaen and Nophine”, It all started long back ago around 1000 years, This world was at its starting stage, with no development found, full of trees, and very fewer people, No big dreams, But our legends Kaen and Nophin had big dreams to make their town a very much better place, dedicating their lives to their town, If a person has only one hope or dream or goal whatever it may be he must have belief in it automatically, The world will get much better, which can lead to many new dreams, and change into ideas which we put it into action to make the world even better for the next generation. “Motivation is the fuel for which Life is the Vehicle”, and “Giving others motivation is pouring more oil into the fire” These legends will give the world more fuel to run! Run as fast as we can! Run over our destiny, As much as we can!

The Path and The Goal - Human Dreams
The Path may be different, but the goal is the same, they introduced several plans and ideas and they brought it into action, they are the god for us! It begins from there yes! Kaen and Nophine Introduced the term “Supreme” for the city, that one idea is grown much better now and become a war, and there is no one to stop it now! Said venture, but Lokts promised him, That he will make the world a very peaceful place! Thank you so much Lokts said Mr.Venorek, Okay Now I will start the history of Kano town! Okay, I am ready was the reply from Lokts!

Kaen and Nophine said that the Supreme is the one who rules everything in the town, they can make the laws and ideas become approved, and they have the power to take decisions for the town, everyone will have the freedom to propose their new ideas, but the decision whether it should be approved or not will be in the hands of “Mr.Supreme Ji”. We all decided that the town must have two Supremes, to ensure more opportunities for people. “Kaen and Nophine” was the two Supremes of our town.

The Power and The Opportunities - Human Rights

We gave Supremes the power, They gave us the opportunities. People proposed many ideas their ideas never worked, the Supremes and the other people of the town were not satisfied by the laws. The Supremes had only one final hope, To get ideas and inspiration from the other developed town, They found the nearest little developed town named “Ouintos” The town was very famous for its magic. There were many magicians, but they wanted the best of the best, So the Supremes went to many magic shows, none of them impressed them, but they had one final hope, “The VH Show” They saw this magician - VH, This was his secret name, he never revealed his real name, whenever they asked. The Supremes were very impressed with his magic with the animals and plants. “Kaen, Yes Nophine, they both agreed!” They called him to show magic in their town. VH asked for advance money, and they both agreed, “Okay this would do” said our Supremes. “We trust you VH,” We trust you! The whole town said. We trusted them like our families After VH came to our town, there was only joy and enjoyment completely. “Remember Lokts” there can be power or god may give us many opportunities for us, it is a doubt whether it lasts long!
Ok, it's 1:00 pm, Enough go sleep tomorrow I will continue the rest of the story said Mr.Venorek Victor, But Lokts will never agree, this story is very amazing I want to hear it please, please Grandpa, asked Lokts, Okay I will tell you, you, haha laughed Mr.Venorek.
Who is VH, Grandpa, why you are telling that god will take our power and opportunities”
You will understand it soon my boy.

As VH, Impressed the whole town, Even though he had many rivals, He had to answer many false accusations, and he could not stay here anymore, they accused him of eating, sleeping, and on his magic, He could not be any free in that town. He decided to leave, But before that, he talked to the Supremes, That he was leaving this town. The Supremes were not happy about this, even though they are here they could do nothing, They both said to VH, We are sorry, Thank you so much for your help You may visit this town whenever you need. Yes, you are welcome, thank you, The Supremes said Goodbye to VH.

The Next day, was again as usual and dull for them, Everyone liked his magic but not him. They missed his magic, but there was nothing for them to see and enjoy, But suddenly there was smoke from their forests, that was set to fire by someone, The whole town panicked, They had their emergency firefighters, But Unfortunately, They could not save their forests and many people in the forests died. That's all it over, No way, He destroyed our whole town!! That magician fellow must have done this, Find him and kill him Supremes!
The Betrayal - The Magic Legend’s Move

The Supremes were very angry with that magical fellow, And they said with a bold and confident clear voice, We will find that magical fellow and put him under our town’s people and give him the cruelest death, So there will be no people again be making any mistakes, or else they must receive this ultimate gift from our town, The cruelest death of them will remain, as a rule, If anyone in this town ever does any mistake, that’s all, No matter of the mistake, This town is not a place for playing with your stupid mistakes, it is, If done It can’t be done again! Understand my dear people? Everyone in the town confidently said yes! The whole town went in search of him 

They could not find him anywhere in that town, and again they got a reason to accuse him that he ran away after burning our town. Again and Again, The reason said, was boosting their egos and they found him finally, at a very big hotel, they dragged him before his wife and everyone in that hotel, you are burning our town and living a happy life here, you must receive the deadliest death of our town. No, I did nothing to your town, I left already, don't make excuses, come with us, finally, he saw his wife and told, “If I die, Make our son get avenge for me.” No talk like this, please leave him, please his wife cried but no one helped! His wife secretly followed them and saw what was happening, she even went fell into the legs of the townspeople they could not help! They asked his last wish, Then suddenly Lokts Mother was awake and she said  “He said boldly and confidently, my son will come for me! He will come for VH, “Victorine Helcain” Lakine, I will be there for both of you don't cry. Victorine, our son will become the Supreme of the town, punish them for their Ultimate foolishness! She cried! And Boom! They killed him, It is not over you fools she cried and left! With one single hope,” His son will return! Say Lokts, I am your he is your father, Will you return for him?

Lokts cried as much as he can, Lokts could not bear it at all, and he was sure that he will avenge his father, and said Yes Mom I will sure return for my Dad! We will all three live happy and prosperous! Ever! His mother smiled! 

But Ms.Lakine had one doubt, how does he know this hidden secret for a long time? When she tried to ask him, he was asleep already. She was very doubtful, With that Lokts slept, and Lokts will never forget this promise! NEVER EVER!

But the thought of who Mr.Venorek was not letting Ms.Lakine sleep at all, She tried to sleep but she could not! And she thought that she must ask it Mr.Venorek before leaving from here!
This was a secret of the town! Which no one could breathe of! She was imagining something, she could not sleep she thought of him as a member of the town or as a close friend of Mr.Victorine. But she was sure, that Mr.Venorek must know something about Mr.Victorine.

But anyways until a mystery is solved, it won't become a history!
The Investigation - The Mystery of Kano


Even though they killed Mr.Victorine, It is not over, some people in that town, thought that Victorine could not have done this. They had a strong belief in him and however, he helped them to improve their town’s development. So the members of the town who all believed Victorine did not set fire to our village, gathered at a secret meeting, and they named the investigation project “Project MMV” They all started investigating very secretly they used code language and dressed differently, sometimes acted as they came from a different town, etc…

They all strongly believed that Victorine was not the culprit. The head of Mission MMV, Said that we have to steal the contracts and the details of which Mr.Victorine came to Kano town. It was wrong and very bad to do, but they had no other choice, They planned to dress up differently and changed their total appearance and said that they came from a different town named “Unoiseten” 

No one could find out the people’s real identity including their family also, But they had to steal it, They had a secret plan for it that is to ask another contract for Kano town, that they will be a developed town, They stated that their town was very famous for its circus show, But the people of the Kano town, knew this already, that was their plan, it was working correctly, and now the team of Mission MMV, they offered a contract to develop their town, the Supremes of the town agreed this as a free offer, so they agreed. The Supremes thought that they already had gained money from the audience in the magic show, cause they will pay more tax, and now through this circus show, with this, they can afford to again plant trees and develop a forest, they needed money, and the money was coming to them offering will they say no?

 No at all right and it was cheap also, so they agreed, and the head of the Mission MMV understood that the supreme wanted money, and people call them legends, he thought to himself, that he will make this town a safer place, not with these toxic people who wanted money and cheating people as they are helping, and accusing the person who made the town to earn money and kill them. No way I won't let this happen, and that night when the Supremes were preparing the contract, they went to their office secretly, even they escaped with it, there was an investigation into who stole it, and again as they accused the Unoiseten town people, they were found nowhere, but when they removed their costumes, the Mission MMV head’s child saw him and confessed the truth, that’s all, they were hanged to death, but the team had managed to escape and start a new life after leaving this town, he came back as an old man where nobody recognizes him, his wife helped a young lady who was having a baby, and he agreed to stay with the little boy and his mother, I think I\you all know who I am talking about! 

We will know about the real mystery of Kano town, Soon! Good things take time to happen!!!

Yes, We arrived at the end of Part-1, Part-2 comes soon, amazing and good things take time to happen, it is very rare, you just wait for it works hard for it, and it will and must arrive at the most power!!!!!
