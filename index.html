    <h1>What is Glowry?</h1> <br>
    <i><p>Glowry is an initiative started by <b>Sarvesh Jayakandan and J.S. Sri Hari</b> on the first of May 2023. Its Ultimate Motive is to change the NDT world to a more productive and effective one, which can be experienced by learning with us in the most effective way. Glowry was started in order to enhance and organize a better world for NDT, Where everything can be organized perfectly and become even more <b>Productive</b>, you may trust us and come join to the world of Glowry. Thank You!</p></i> <br>

    <h1>Why Choose Glowry?</h1> <br>
    <p><i>Glowry Is trusted by several users and memebers and who are working in the field of <b>NDT!</b> and who wants to improve their NDT skills, By leaarning with us you may experience a better way of learning NDT and excel in your jobs and business. by studying in a software or a website will not be so efficient so just blind enroll in our courses and just study better and more efficient, come do not think too much, just come and enroll. Seeking Cooperation From you, Thank You!</i></p>

   <h1>Lets us Start our Journey to NDT! First of all What is NDT?</h1> <br>
   <p>Non-destructive testing (NDT) is a testing and analysis technique used by industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component, structure or system for characteristic differences or welding defects and discontinuities without causing damage to the original part. NDT is also known as non-destructive examination (NDE), non-destructive inspection (NDI) and non-destructive evaluation (NDE).</p></i>
   <h1>Now, Let us look about the types of NDT:</h1>
   <h2>These Methods Include  <b> Acoustic Emission Testing (AE):</b></h2>
   <p> Accoustic emission (AE) is the phenomenon of radiation of acoustic (elastic) waves in solids that occurs when a material undergoes irreversible changes in its internal structure, for example as a result of crack formation or plastic deformation due to aging, temperature gradients, or external mechanical forces. The waves generated by sources of AE are of practical interest in structural health monitoring (SHM), quality control, system feedback, process monitoring, and other fields. In SHM applications, AE is typically used to detect, locate,[3] and characterise [4] damage.</i></p>
   <h2>Helium Leak Testing:</h2>
   <p>Helium leak test uses <b>Helium</b>, there is a reason to use <b>Helium</b>, (because it is the lightest inert gas), that is use, as a tracer gas and detects it in concentrations as small as one part in 10 million. The helium is selected primarily because it penetrates small leaks readily, is inert and will not react with the test piece while having a naturally low quantity in air making detection less complicated. It is possible to detect leaks as small as 5x10−10 Pa·m3/s in vacuum mode and modern digital machines can detect 5x10−10 Pa·m3/s in sniffing mode.</i></p>
   <h2>Liquid Penetrant Testing (PT):</h2>
   <p>Liquid Penetrant testing works on the basic principle of capilary action Liquid penetrant testing involves the application of a fluid with low viscosity to the material to be tested. This fluid seeps into any defects such as cracks or porosity before a developer is applied which allows the penetrant liquid to seep upwards and create a visible indication of the flaw. The tests can be conducted by using solvent removable penetrants, water washable penetrants or post-emulsifiable penetrants.</p>
   <h2>Ultra Sonic Testing (UT):</h2>
   <p>Ultrasonic Testing entails the transmission of high frequency sound into a material to interact with features within the material that reflect or attenuate it. Ultrasonic testing is broadly divided into Pulse Echo (PE), Through Transmission (TT) and Time of Flight Diffraction (ToFD). Typically the UT inspection system consists of a ultrasonic transducer, pulser/receiver, and display unit.</p>
