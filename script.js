    'what is ndt and why it is important': "Non-destructive testing (NDT) is a testing and analysis technique used by industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component, structure or system for characteristic differences or welding defects and discontinuities without causing damage to the original part. NDT also known as non-destructive examination (NDE), non-destructive inspection (NDI) and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). or in detail can be explained as Nondestructive testing (NDT) is any of a wide group of analysis techniques used in science and technology industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.[1] The terms nondestructive examination (NDE), nondestructive inspection (NDI), and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology.[2] Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. The six most frequently used NDT methods are eddy-current, magnetic-particle, liquid penetrant, radiographic, ultrasonic, and visual testing.[3] NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art.[1] Innovations in the field of nondestructive testing have had a profound impact on medical imaging, including on echocardiography, medical ultrasonography, and digital radiography. It is surely important because we are not destructing any object we are testing it's quality without destructing it. Non-destructive testing offers reliable and accurate results which can provide stability. Since this testing method does not damage the components, all pieces of equipment and machinery can be tested which can minimise the inaccuracy of test results and any undermined irregularities. The reassurance gained from the meticulous testing is an invaluable advantage of NDT. Knowing that all the machinery in a factory is regularly tested and complying with the standards adds a level of confidence in quality and security of the equipment as well as the safety of the operators of this machinery. If a component fails or breaks down, not only is the business going to suffer drastically due to the unexpected shutdown but, in the worst cases, it can end up in irreparable catastrophes which can cause harm to people and the environment. Proper use of NDT can prevent these failures by identifying the areas of concern before they become a problem through failure analysis procedures. Non-destructive testing is carried out to ascertain that the components or materials being used are not damaged or faulty and are fit to be used by personnel. The result of testing can show whether the components need to be repaired or if they are safe for operation. Learn more by clicking Learn more in the sidebar. ",

    'difference between non destructive testing and destuctive testing': 'Yes, Sure The difference between NDT AND Destructive Testing are as follows: Destructive testing destroys or changes the part in some way such that even if it passes the test it is no longer fit for service. Examples might be tensile testing, 3 point bend test or macro sectioning. NDT does not destroy or change the part such that it is still fit for service if it passes the test. They are only done for minimum products out of a maximum becuase the all products are of the same type. Non-destructive testing is a valuable technique used by many industries to evaluate the properties of a material, component, structure or system without causing any damage. It is done for all products because it does not deal any damage or destructon to the desired testing product.',

    'what are the types of ndt': 'There are many types of NDT, Here are the types of NDT in detail First - Acoustic emission (AE)[AE testing is also a continuous Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) method] is a non-destructive testing (NDT) testing is a technique that detects and monitors the release of ultrasonic stress waves from localised sources when a material deforms under stress. It works by mounting small sensors into it. The sensors convert the stress waves into electrical signals, which are relayed to an acquisition PC for processing, here acquisition PC refers to the PC which is a collection of software and hardware that allows one to measure or control the physical characteristics of something in the real world. The waves are captured when the component is submitted to an external stimulus, such as high pressures, loads or temperatures.  As the damage grows in the component, there is a greater release of energy. The rates in which the acoustic emission is detected, the activity, and the intensity of the acoustic emission, the loudness, are monitored and used for assessing structural integrity and for health monitoring of components. Acoustic emission can be thought of as tiny earthquakes that occur in the material. The technique globally monitors a component for defects, allowing large structures and machines to be monitored while in operation with minimal disruption, unlike destructive testing. By using multiple sensors, acoustic emission sources (and hence the damage) can be located. Through signal analysis, the presence of different source mechanisms can also be determined. We have to know thatThere are two AE testing methods: transient and continuous The transient method captures AE bursts that exceed a threshold (loudness level) and extract features such as peak amplitude, signal energy and duration of the burst. These features are then used to assess the condition of the component under test. The continuous method captures all AE within a set time period, for example 1/10th of a second. Then, features such as average signal level and root-mean squared (RMS) values are then extracted. Here (RMS) values are equivalent to the value of a dc voltage that causes an equal amount of heat (power dissipation) due to the circuit current flowing through a resistance. Acoustic emission testing can be conducted in a laboratory, as well as in-field conditions, over both relatively short durations, such as a few hours, and longer durations, such as a few months. Wireless data relay methods make it possible to analyse the data remotely. Next method of NDT is Electromagnetic Testing (ET) - This testing method uses an electric current or magnetic field which is passed through a conductive part. There are three types of electromagnetic testing, including eddy current testing, alternating current field measurement (ACFM) and remote field testing (RFT). Eddy current testing uses an alternating current coil to induce an electromagnetic field into the test piece, alternating current field measurement and remote field testing both use a probe to introduce a magnetic field, with RFT generally used to test pipes.',
    'what is magnetic particle testing': 'This NDT process uses magnetic fields to find discontinuities at or near the surface of ferromagnetic materials. The magnetic field can be created with a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, which requires a current to be applied. The magnetic field will highlight any discontinuities as the magnetic flux lines produce leakage, which can be seen by using magnetic particles that are drawn into the discontinuity. or can be defined as the process for detecting surface and shallow subsurface discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials such as iron, nickel, cobalt, and some of their alloys. The process puts a magnetic field into the part. The piece can be magnetized by direct or indirect magnetization.',

Only used on closed systems, pressure change testing uses either pressure or a vacuum to monitor the test piece. A loss of pressure or vacuum over a set time span will show that there is a leak in the system. Halogen diode testing also uses pressure to find leaks, except in this case air and a halogen-based tracer gas are mixed together and a halogen diode detection unit (or 'sniffer') is used to locate any leaks. Mass spectrometer testing uses helium or a helium and air mix inside a test chamber with a 'sniffer' to detect any changes in the air sample, which would indicate a leak. Alternatively, a vacuum can be used, in which case the mass spectrometer will sample the vacuum chamber to detect ionised helium, which will show that there has been a leak.

    "what is roblox": "Roblox (/ˈroʊblɒks/) is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called Robux. As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, including more than half of all American children under 16.[9][10] Although Roblox has received generally positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism for its moderation and microtransactions and accusations of exploitative practices directed toward children.",
    "what is dough commander in blox fruits": "Dough is a Mythical Elemental Blox Fruit that costs MoneyIcon 2,800,000 or RobuxIcon 2,400. It was added in Update 9, and received awakening in Update 17.3. To fully awaken this fruit, the player will need FragmentIcon 18,500. This fruit is the most expensive to awaken alongside Phoenix, both having advanced raids. This fruit has a special chip needed to start its raid, by using the Red Key dropped by Dough King to unlock the door to the Cake Scientist which will unlock it permanently. (Dough King is considered the hardest boss in the game by many players) This fruit is one of many that have an animation in it’s physical form, the others being Phoenix, Spirit, Spider, Dragon, Leopard, Venom, Control, Rubber, Portal, and Gravity.

    "what is buddha fruit": "Buddha, formerly known as Human: Buddha is a Legendary Beast fruit with a 5% chance of being in stock and a 6.6% chance of spawning every hour. This fruit can also be obtained with a small chance from Blox Fruit Gacha. The fruit can be awakened and is considered one of the best fruits for grinding and supporting in a raid, and also for PvP due to its spamming abilities. To fully awaken this fruit, you will need FragmentIcon 14,500, but it's recommend to just awaken the first ability to make you more larger. The order of the moves for awakening Buddha : Z, F, X, C, V. When transformed into a giant golden Buddha, the user gains extreme hitbox and a 40% damage reduction, which increases to 50% when the fruit is awakened. The user also gains extreme hitbox up to 800% (or up to seven times) the normal hitbox of an untransformed player. The awakened buddha is nearly 3 times the size of the unawakened version, which is big enough to make you immune to water damage. The user also becomes an easy target when transformed due to the big hitbox. I think dough will be on stock tomorrow morning! It is my own opinion by Vast!",

    "what is pt": "Liquid penetrant testing involves the application of a fluid with low viscosity to the material to be tested. This fluid seeps into any defects such as cracks or porosity before a developer is applied which allows the penetrant liquid to seep upwards and create a visible indication of the flaw. Liquid penetrant tests can be conducted using solvent removable penetrants, water washable penetrants or post-emulsifiable penetrants.",
    "what is liquid penetrant testing": "Penetrant method of non-destructive testing is dedicated to detecting surface defects invisible to the naked eye. It is based on use of capillary properties of liquids (namely, on capillary penetration of special indicator liquids inside defects). This method reveals defects by forming an indication patterns on the surface of tested items. These patterns have high optical (luminance and color) contrast and width exceeding width of the defect opening. When performing testing a special wetting liquid (penetrating liquid, penetrant) is applied on the surface of the tested item. By impact of capillary forces this liquid fills cavities of surface defects and then it is removed from the tested area. Defects are detected already by applying a developer to the surface of the tested area. The developer absorbs penetrant remaining in cavities of defects. As a result of this process, there is either a red indication pattern appears on the developer's white background (dye penetrant testing) or a luminescent indication pattern appears in ultraviolet rays (luminescent penetrant testing).",
    "neutron radiographic testing": "Neutron radiography is a nondestructive imaging technique that is capable of visualizing the internal characteristics of a sample. The transmission of neutrons through a medium is dependent upon the neutron cross sections for the nuclei in the medium. Differential attenuation of neutrons through a medium may be measured, mapped, and then visualized. The resulting image may then be utilized to analyze the internal characteristics of the sample. Neutron radiography is a complementary technique to X-ray radiography. Both techniques visualize the attenuation through a medium. The major advantage of neutron radiography is its ability to reveal light elements such as hydrogen found in corrosion products and water. Learn more by learning with us, even you may watch our youtube videos by clicking the left side youtube icon. Neutron radiography allows the investigation of local fluid distribution in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) under operating conditions. Spatial resolutions in the order of some tens of micrometers over the full test cell area are achieved. This offers the possibility of studying large stack cells as well as small test cells. Measurements can be performed in both through-plane and in-plane mode. In the through-plane mode, an overview of local water and gas distribution in the flow field channels is obtained. Combined studies of high resolution neutron radiography and segmented cell measurements enable a correlation of local fluid distribution and local performance. The knowledge of this interdependency is essential to achieve high performance and durability of DMFCs.",

    "what is radiographic testing": "In Radiography Testing the test-part is placed between the radiation source and film (or detector). The material density and thickness differences of the test-part will attenuate (i.e. reduce) the penetrating radiation through interaction processes involving scattering and/or absorption. The differences in absorption are then recorded on film(s) or through an electronic means. In industrial radiography there are several imaging methods available, techniques to display the final image, i.e. Film Radiography, Real Time Radiography (RTR), Computed Tomography (CT), Digital Radiography (DR), and Computed Radiography (CR). There are two different radioactive sources available for industrial use;  X-ray and Gamma-ray. These radiation sources use higher energy level, i.e. shorter wavelength, versions of the electromagnetic waves. Because of the radioactivity involved in radiography testing, it is of paramount importance to ensure that the Local Rules is strictly adhered during operation. Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the lab based advanced NDT methods that TWI offers to industry. CT is a radiographic based technique that provides both cross-sectional and 3D volume images of the object under inspection. These images allow the internal structure of the test object to be inspected without the inherent superimposition associated with 2D radiography. This feature allows detailed analysis of the internal structure of a wide range of components. Learn more in our courses.",

    "what is neutron cross section": "In nuclear physics, the concept of a neutron cross section is used to express the likelihood of interaction between an incident neutron and a target nucleus. The neutron cross section σ can be defined as the area in cm2 for which the number of neutron-nuclei reactions taking place is equal to the product of the number of incident neutrons that would pass through the area and the number of target nuclei.[1][page needed] In conjunction with the neutron flux, it enables the calculation of the reaction rate, for example to derive the thermal power of a nuclear power plant. The standard unit for measuring the cross section is the barn, which is equal to 10−28 m2 or 10−24 cm2. The larger the neutron cross section, the more likely a neutron will react with the nucleus.",

    "what is thermal testing": "Thermography, including infrared thermography (IRT), thermal imaging, and thermal video, is a thermal imaging science used for multiple applications. The technique uses thermographic cameras to detect radiation in the long-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (around 9,000–14,000 nanometers or 9–14 µm) and produces images of this thermal radiation, known as thermograms. The blackbody radiation law states that all objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit infrared radiation, meaning that it is possible to ‘see’ with thermography without visible illumination by reading temperature variations. As the temperature of an object increases, so does the amount of radiation it emits, which means that thermography can read variations in temperature range. When using a thermal imaging camera, warm objects show up against cooler backgrounds regardless of time of day, making thermography useful to the military and for surveillance cameras. Thermography also has lots of uses in the medical industry, including items such as infrared thermometers. Thermography can be split into two distinct types, passive and active. Passive thermography uses the natural temperature of a part to create and image, while active thermography involves heating the surface of an object and then observing the heat decay as it cools. Active thermography shows flaws in the material by variations in the temperature decay rate. Various testing procedure in active thermography are deployed to bring energy to the specimen inspected: pulsed thermography, step heating, lock-in thermography and vibrothermography. Thermography involves the use of thermal imagers, which are sophisticated devices that measure the natural emission of infrared radiation from a heated object to produce a thermal picture or video. Modern infrared cameras are portable and easy to operate, meaning that they can be used for many different applications. Objects emit electromagnetic energy when heated, with more energy being released as the temperature increases. This energy is emitted as a wave which travels at the speed of light. The human eye responds to visible light in the range of 0.4 to 0.75 microns, but the majority of infrared temperature measurements range from 0.2 to 20 microns. A thermal imager is able to focus this energy on to a detector much like a regular camera, except it responds to the infrared radiation rather than visible light. This image is represented in different colours to convey the temperature information. Because infrared energy is emitted, transmitted and reflected by an object, infrared cameras use algorithms to interpret the data to create an accurate interpretation of the operating temperature. Incident Radiant Power = Emitted Radiant Power + Transmitted Radiant Power + Reflected Radiant Power The incident radiant power is the profile as viewed through a thermal imaging camera, emitted radiant power is the energy that is intended to be measured, transmitted radiant power is that which passes through the object from a remote thermal source, and reflected radiant power is the energy that is reflected from the object from a remote thermal source. This is known as radiant heat exchange. A thermal imager will also take account of environmental factors such as cooling from wind to build a thermogram that is usually displayed as a JPEG.

Modern infrared cameras are portable and easy to operate, meaning that they can be used for many different applications. Objects emit electromagnetic energy when heated, with more energy being released as the temperature increases. This energy is emitted as a wave which travels at the speed of light. The human eye responds to visible light in the range of 0.4 to 0.75 microns, but the majority of infrared temperature measurements range from 0.2 to 20 microns. A thermal imager is able to focus this energy on to a detector much like a regular camera, except it responds to the infrared radiation rather than visible light. This image is represented in different colours to convey the temperature information. Because infrared energy is emitted, transmitted and reflected by an object, infrared cameras use algorithms to interpret the data to create an accurate interpretation of the operating temperature. Incident Radiant Power = Emitted Radiant Power + Transmitted Radiant Power + Reflected Radiant Power The incident radiant power is the profile as viewed through a thermal imaging camera, emitted radiant power is the energy that is intended to be measured, transmitted radiant power is that which passes through the object from a remote thermal source, and reflected radiant power is the energy that is reflected from the object from a remote thermal source. This is known as radiant heat exchange. A thermal imager will also take account of environmental factors such as cooling from wind to build a thermogram that is usually displayed as a JPEG.

    "what is laser testing": "Laser testing falls into three categories including holographic testing, laser profilometry and laser shearography. Holographic testing uses a laser to detect changes in the surface of the material which has been subjected to stress such as heat, pressure or vibration. The results are then compared to an undamaged reference sample to show defects. Laser profilometry uses a high speed rotating laser light source and miniature optics to detect corrosion, pitting, erosion and cracks by detecting changes in the surface via a 3D image generated from the surface topography. Laser shearography uses laser light to create an image before the surface is stressed and a new image is created. These images are compared to one another to determine if any defects are present. Laser Shearography uses the coherent and monochromatic properties of laser light to illuminate the surface of a component under investigation. If the surface is optically rough e.g. not a mirror surface, the lights reflected by the component surface will generate a speckle pattern.  This speckle pattern is then recorded by a digital camera.",
    "what is magnetic flux leakage": "This method uses a powerful magnet to create magnetic fields which saturate steel structures such as pipelines and storage tanks. A sensor is then used to detect changes in magnetic flux density which show any reduction in material due to pitting, erosion or corrosion.",
    "what is mfl": "This method uses a powerful magnet to create magnetic fields which saturate steel structures such as pipelines and storage tanks. A sensor is then used to detect changes in magnetic flux density which show any reduction in material due to pitting, erosion or corrosion.",
    "what is microwave testing": "This method is restricted to use on dielectric materials and uses microwave frequencies transmitted and received by a test probe. The test probe detects changes in dielectric properties, such as shrinkage cavities, pores, foreign materials or cracks and displays the results as B or C scans.",
    "what is pulse echo inspections": "This technique introduces a sound beam into the test material surface. The sound will travel through the part, either reaching the rear wall of the material and then returning to the transducer or returning early when reflected from a discontinuity within the part. If the acoustic velocity is known, the time interval recorded is then used to derive the distance travelled in the material.",

(A part is soaked in thinned oil, then painted with a white coating that dries to a powder. Oil seeping out from cracks turns the white powder brown, allowing the cracks to be detected.) This was the precursor to modern liquid penetrant tests. 1895 – Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovers what are now known as X-rays. In his first paper he discusses the possibility of flaw detection. 1920 – Dr. H. H. Lester begins development of industrial radiography for metals. 1924 – Lester uses radiography to examine castings to be installed in a Boston Edison Company steam pressure power plant.

    "certification schemes in ndt": "1.Employer Based Certification: Under this concept the employer compiles their own Written Practice. The written practice defines the responsibilities of each level of certification, as implemented by the company, and describes the training, experience and examination requirements for each level of certification. In industrial sectors the written practices are usually based on recommended practice SNT-TC-1A of the American Society for Nondestructive Testing.[22] ANSI standard CP-189 outlines requirements for any written practice that conforms to the standard.[23] For aviation, space, and defense (ASD) applications NAS 410 sets further requirements for NDT personnel, and is published by AIA – Aerospace Industries Association which is made up of US aerospace airframe and powerplant manufacturers. This is the basis document for EN 4179[24] and other (USA) NIST-recognized aerospace standards for the Qualification and Certification (employer-based) of Nondestructive Testing personnel. NAS 410  also sets the requirements also for National NDT Boards, which allow and proscribe personal certification schemes. NAS 410  allows ASNT Certification as a portion of the qualifications needed for ASD certification.[25] 2.Personal Central Certification: The concept of central certification is that an NDT operator can obtain certification from a central certification authority, that is recognized by most employers, third parties and/or government authorities. Industrial standards for central certification schemes include ISO 9712,[26] and ANSI/ASNT CP-106[27] (used for the ASNT ACCP [28] scheme). Certification under these standards involves training, work experience under supervision and passing a written and practical examination set up by the independent certification authority. EN 473[29] was another central certification scheme, very similar to ISO 9712, which was withdrawn when CEN replaced it with EN ISO 9712 in 2012.",
