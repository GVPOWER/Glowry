    'what is ndt and why it is important': "Non-destructive testing (NDT) is a testing and analysis technique used by industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component, structure or system for characteristic differences or welding defects and discontinuities without causing damage to the original part. NDT also known as non-destructive examination (NDE), non-destructive inspection (NDI) and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). or in detail can be explained as Nondestructive testing (NDT) is any of a wide group of analysis techniques used in science and technology industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.[1] The terms nondestructive examination (NDE), nondestructive inspection (NDI), and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology.[2] Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. The six most frequently used NDT methods are eddy-current, magnetic-particle, liquid penetrant, radiographic, ultrasonic, and visual testing.[3] NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art.[1] Innovations in the field of nondestructive testing have had a profound impact on medical imaging, including on echocardiography, medical ultrasonography, and digital radiography. It is surely important because we are not destructing any object we are testing it's quality without destructing it. Non-destructive testing offers reliable and accurate results which can provide stability. Since this testing method does not damage the components, all pieces of equipment and machinery can be tested which can minimise the inaccuracy of test results and any undermined irregularities. The reassurance gained from the meticulous testing is an invaluable advantage of NDT. Knowing that all the machinery in a factory is regularly tested and complying with the standards adds a level of confidence in quality and security of the equipment as well as the safety of the operators of this machinery. If a component fails or breaks down, not only is the business going to suffer drastically due to the unexpected shutdown but, in the worst cases, it can end up in irreparable catastrophes which can cause harm to people and the environment. Proper use of NDT can prevent these failures by identifying the areas of concern before they become a problem through failure analysis procedures. Non-destructive testing is carried out to ascertain that the components or materials being used are not damaged or faulty and are fit to be used by personnel. The result of testing can show whether the components need to be repaired or if they are safe for operation. Learn more by clicking Learn more in the sidebar. ",

    'explain me in detail about difference of non destructive testing and destuctive testing':'Yes, Sure The difference between NDT AND Destructive Testing are as follows: Destructive testing destroys or changes the part in some way such that even if it passes the test it is no longer fit for service. Examples might be tensile testing, 3 point bend test or macro sectioning. NDT does not destroy or change the part such that it is still fit for service if it passes the test. They are only done for minimum products out of a maximum becuase the all products are of the same type. Non-destructive testing is a valuable technique used by many industries to evaluate the properties of a material, component, structure or system without causing any damage. It is done for all products because it does not deal any damage or destructon to the desired testing product.',

    'explain me in detail about types of ndt':'There are many types of NDT, Here are the types of NDT in detail First - Acoustic emission (AE)[AE testing is also a continuous Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) method] is a non-destructive testing (NDT) testing is a technique that detects and monitors the release of ultrasonic stress waves from localised sources when a material deforms under stress. It works by mounting small sensors into it. The sensors convert the stress waves into electrical signals, which are relayed to an acquisition PC for processing, here acquisition PC refers to the PC which is a collection of software and hardware that allows one to measure or control the physical characteristics of something in the real world. The waves are captured when the component is submitted to an external stimulus, such as high pressures, loads or temperatures.  As the damage grows in the component, there is a greater release of energy. The rates in which the acoustic emission is detected, the activity, and the intensity of the acoustic emission, the loudness, are monitored and used for assessing structural integrity and for health monitoring of components. Acoustic emission can be thought of as tiny earthquakes that occur in the material. The technique globally monitors a component for defects, allowing large structures and machines to be monitored while in operation with minimal disruption, unlike destructive testing. By using multiple sensors, acoustic emission sources (and hence the damage) can be located. Through signal analysis, the presence of different source mechanisms can also be determined. We have to know thatThere are two AE testing methods: transient and continuous The transient method captures AE bursts that exceed a threshold (loudness level) and extract features such as peak amplitude, signal energy and duration of the burst. These features are then used to assess the condition of the component under test. The continuous method captures all AE within a set time period, for example 1/10th of a second. Then, features such as average signal level and root-mean squared (RMS) values are then extracted. Here (RMS) values are equivalent to the value of a dc voltage that causes an equal amount of heat (power dissipation) due to the circuit current flowing through a resistance. Acoustic emission testing can be conducted in a laboratory, as well as in-field conditions, over both relatively short durations, such as a few hours, and longer durations, such as a few months. Wireless data relay methods make it possible to analyse the data remotely. Next method of NDT is Electromagnetic Testing (ET) - This testing method uses an electric current or magnetic field which is passed through a conductive part. There are three types of electromagnetic testing, including eddy current testing, alternating current field measurement (ACFM) and remote field testing (RFT). Eddy current testing uses an alternating current coil to induce an electromagnetic field into the test piece, alternating current field measurement and remote field testing both use a probe to introduce a magnetic field, with RFT generally used to test pipes.',
    'what is magnetic particle testing':'This NDT process uses magnetic fields to find discontinuities at or near the surface of ferromagnetic materials. The magnetic field can be created with a permanent magnet or an electromagnet, which requires a current to be applied. The magnetic field will highlight any discontinuities as the magnetic flux lines produce leakage, which can be seen by using magnetic particles that are drawn into the discontinuity. or can be defined as the process for detecting surface and shallow subsurface discontinuities in ferromagnetic materials such as iron, nickel, cobalt, and some of their alloys. The process puts a magnetic field into the part. The piece can be magnetized by direct or indirect magnetization.',

    "what is et ":"Electromagnetic testing (ET), as a form of nondestructive testing, is the process of inducing electric currents or magnetic fields or both inside a test object and observing the electromagnetic response. If the test is set up properly, a defect inside the test object creates a measurable response.

Common methods: Eddy-current testing (ECT) is used to detect near-surface cracks and corrosion in metallic objects such as tubes and aircraft fuselage and structures. ECT is more commonly applied to nonferromagnetic materials, since in ferromagnetic materials the depth of penetration is relatively small. Magnetic particle inspection (MT or MPI) is a form of MFL where small magnetic particles in the form of a powder or liquid are sprayed on the magnetized steel test object and gather at surface-breaking cracks.

    "what is leak testing":"Leak testing can be broken down into four different methods - bubble leak testing, pressure change testing, halogen diode testing and mass spectrometer testing. Bubble leak testing uses a tank of liquid, or a soap solution for larger parts, to detect gas (usually air) leaking from the test piece in the form of bubbles. Only used on closed systems, pressure change testing uses either pressure or a vacuum to monitor the test piece. A loss of pressure or vacuum over a set time span will show that there is a leak in the system. Halogen diode testing also uses pressure to find leaks, except in this case air and a halogen-based tracer gas are mixed together and a halogen diode detection unit (or 'sniffer') is used to locate any leaks. Mass spectrometer testing uses helium or a helium and air mix inside a test chamber with a 'sniffer' to detect any changes in the air sample, which would indicate a leak. Alternatively, a vacuum can be used, in which case the mass spectrometer will sample the vacuum chamber to detect ionised helium, which will show that there has been a leak.
